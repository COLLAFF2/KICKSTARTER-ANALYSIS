## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most successful month was May. June and July did well also.December had almost exactly the same amount of successful and failed campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Goals set for the campaign under one thousand had a high success rate. Those that had goals over forty-five thousand had a greater rate of failure. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Some limitations are that you're unable to see the correlation of date and goal together. Are the goals in the more successful  months lower or higher and vice versa.



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Graphs showing the success rate between campaign goal and months.
