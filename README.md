# KICKSTARTER-ANALYSIS
PERFORMING ANALYSIS ON KICKSTARTER DATA TO UNCOVER TRENDS
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Looking for trends based on launch dates and goals.
### Purpose
Looking to see if there is a correlation in the length of campaign and the amount of the set goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
May and June were the most successful months for the campaign . Also, campaigns that had goals set under twenty thousand  had a higher percentage of success. The analysis would be even more helpful if we  could see if the success rate in months and goals correlate. Do the successful months have lower goals set?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June had high rates of success. July aslo did well. Where as December had the lowest rate of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 The campaigns that had set goal of twenty thousand or less had a higher rate of success. The rate of success was highest when the goal was a thousand or less. Also the highest rate of failure was when the goal was  forty-five thousand or higher. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenge is that we don't have data that shows if the rate of successful months had to do with the goal set.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most successful month was May. June and July did well also.December had almost exactly the same amount of successful and failed campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Goals set for the campaign under one thousand had a high success rate. Those that had goals over forty-five thousand had a greater rate of failure. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Some limitations are that you're unable to see the correlation of date and goal together. Are the goals in the more successful  months lower or higher and vice versa.



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-Graphs showing the success rate between campaign goal and months.
