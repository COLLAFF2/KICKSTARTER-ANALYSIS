PERFORMING ANALYSIS ON KICKSTARTER DATA TO UNCOVER TRENDS

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

 Using excel to Look for trends based on launch dates and goals.
### Purpose

 Using excel  to see if there is a correlation in the launch date of campaign and the amount of the set goal.
 
## Analysis and Challenges

 In my analysis I used spreadsheets,tables, and charts  to look for trends in the theater launch date and the goals set for projects. I'm looking to see if the success rate was influenced by the goal or the launch date that was set.
 May and June were the most successful months for the campaign . Also, campaigns that had goals set under twenty thousand  had a higher percentage of success. The analysis would be even more helpful if we  could see if the success rate in months and goals correlate. Do the successful months have lower goals set?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 Collected data on the parent category and years. I used a pivot table to help filter by years and theater.In this pivot table we used the count of outcomes of successful, failed , live, and canceled campaigns based on the month of the year.
 May and June had high rates of success. July aslo did well. Where as December had the lowest rate of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  To determine the sucess rate of outcomes based on goal I created an excel spreadsheet. Here the goal  is stated in the first column in ranges from lowest to highest. I looked at the number of failed, successful, and canceled projects for each goal range. Then looked at the percentage of failed, successful, and canceled project of the goal range and the the total of projects for each category.
  The campaigns that had set goal of twenty thousand or less had a higher rate of success. The rate of success was highest when the goal was a thousand or less. Also the highest rate of failure was when the goal was  forty-five thousand or higher. ![outcomes_vs_goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107623913/174673643-561f77ed-26ea-4b5f-b2b7-49e017e8cf68.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Challenge is that we don't have data that shows if the rate of successful months had to do with the goal set.


## Results


The most successful month was May. June and July did well also.December had almost exactly the same amount of successful and failed campaigns.
 Goals set for the campaign under one thousand had a high success rate. Those that had goals over forty-five thousand had a greater rate of failure. 
 Some limitations are that you're unable to see the correlation of date and goal together. Are the goals in the more successful  months lower or higher and vice versa.
